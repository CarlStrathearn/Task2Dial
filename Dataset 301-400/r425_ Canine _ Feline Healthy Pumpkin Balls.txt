User: I would like to make Canine and Feline Healthy Pumpkin Balls
Robot: First, preheat your oven to 180ºC. In a bowl mix 120g of canned pumpkin or sweet potato, 60g of molasses, 30ml of olive oil and 60ml of water using a spoon. 
User: I have preheated the oven and mixed together the other ingredients. What next?
Robot: Add 240g of rice flour, a pinch of baking powder, and a pinch of baking soda to the mixture and stir until the dough softens. Stir in 60g of dried chopped cranberries, 60g of chopped roasted pumpkin seeds, and 60g of carob chips. 
User: I have stirred together those ingredients in the bowl, what now?
Robot: Now, scoop a small spoonful of dough and roll it into balls using your hands. This works best when your hands are wet. Once you have done this, set the balls onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, flattening with a fork. Bake for 25 minutes or until dough is hardened. 
User: I have baked the dough balls, what next?
Robot: Next finish with a garnish by melting carob chips in a bowl and drizzling over the cookies. 
User: Thanks for helping me make Canine and Feline Healthy Pumpkin Balls.
