User: I would like to make Pan Seared Sirloin Steaks with Sauteed Onions.
Robot: First heat 30ml of oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Trim and dry with paper towels 900g of steak. While the oil is heating, put the steak in the pan and season both sides with salt and pepper, and sprinkles of cumin and paprika. 
User: I have heated the pan and seasoned the steak, what next?
Robot: Next, place the steaks on the skillet and cook for 2 minutes without moving. Flip the steaks with tongs and reduce the heat to medium. Cook for another 5-6 minutes then transfer the steaks to a large plate or board and loosely cover with foil, let it rest for 12 minutes.
User: I have cooked the steaks. What now?
Robot: Now add an additional 15ml of oil to the pan. Cut an onion in half and thinly slice it with a knife. Add these to the pan, spreading them out with a spatula. Sprinkle them with seasoning the same as the steaks and sautee on a medium heat, turning frequently with the spatula for 12 minutes until softened and caramelized. 
User: The onions are sauteed, what comes next?
Robot: Next, slice the steaks in thin slices and serve with the juices from the pan, adding the onions on top. Enjoy.
