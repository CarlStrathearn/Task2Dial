User: I would like to make Mediterranean Chicken.
Robot: In a small bowl or dish add 60ml of olive oil, the juice from a lemon, some salt and pepper, and 3 cloves of garlic pressed with the side of a knife. Stir together using a spoon. 
User: I have mixed those ingredients together, what next?
Robot: Next place 2 chicken breasts in a shallow marinating dish and turn and coat the chicken with the mixture. Further season the chicken by coating one side of each piece with poultry seasoning. 
User: I have seasoned the chicken, what now?
Robot: Now marinate the chicken in the fridge for 45 minutes, turning over half way through. 
User: The chicken has finished marinating, what is the next step?
Robot: The next step is to grill the chicken on an outdoor barbeque on medium or low heat to prevent flare ups from the oil. Cook these well, serve and enjoy.
