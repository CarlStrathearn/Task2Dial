User: I would like to make Black Forest Cheesecake Squares. 
Robot: First preheat the oven to 180ºC and grease a 23x33cm baking pan. Reserve 240g of the fudge marble cake mix from the packet and set aside. 
User: The oven is ready and I have reserved some cake mix, what is the next step?
Robot: In a large bowl combine the remaining cake mix with 60ml of oil and one egg using a whisk. Do this until a dough forms. When the dough has formed, press the bottom of the dough to the pan and push 2.5cm up the sides of the greased pan. Bake this for 8 minutes. 
User: I have baked the dough, now what?
Robot: In a large bowl beat three 225g tubs of cream cheese until smooth and creamy using a hand mixer. Add 2 eggs one at a time and beat well after each addition.
User: I have beaten the cream cheese with the eggs, what now?
Robot: Now, blend in the reserved cake mix, 120g of sugar, 120g of sour cream and 120g of whip cream. Blend these together at a low speed with a hand mixer before beating together for 3 minutes at a medium speed.
User: I have blended the cheese mixture. What is next? 
Robot: Next, reserve 480ml of the cheese mixture and spoon the remaining mixture over the crust baked in the pan. Add the reserved cake mix to the reserved cheese mix and blend together well before spooning the chocolate mixture evenly over the cheese mixture.
User: I have spooned both mixtures into the crust in the pan. What comes next?
Robot: Bake this for 30-40 minutes until the edges are set and the center is almost set. Run a knife around the sides of the pan and cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Spoon one 600g can of cherry pie filling over the top of the cheesecake and then refrigerate overnight before serving into squares.
