Robot: First preheat the oven to 220ºC.
User: The oven is heated, what next?
Robot: In a small bowl whisk 30ml of balsamic vinegar, 30ml of olive oil, 10ml of soy sauce, and 2 garlic cloves minced using a garlic press. Add in some salt and pepper to your taste. 
User: I have  whisked those ingredients together, what now?
Robot: Now put 900g of your chosen fish in a zip lock bag and add in the marinade from the small bowl. Turn the bag to coat evenly and place in a refrigerator for 1-2 hours. 
User: I have  coated the fish with the marinade. What do I do now?
Robot: Now, roast the fish in the oven using a roasting pan for about 10 minutes per 250mm of thickness. The fish should be flaky but still moist.
