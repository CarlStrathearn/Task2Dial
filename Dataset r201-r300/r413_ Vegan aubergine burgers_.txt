User: I would like to make Vegan Aubergine Burgers
Robot: First, preheat a griddle pan over medium heat. While it heats, make the avocado mayo. Cut 1 small ripe avocado in half using a knife and separate and remove the stone. Scoop the inside out and chop it into rough pieces. Get a small bowl and place the chopped avocado inside. Add 2 tsp of fresh lime juice, 1 small clove of garlic crushed in a garlic crusher, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper onto the avocado. Mash the ingredients together with a fork until it is as smooth as possible, then set aside. 
User: I’ve preheated the oven and prepared the avocado mayo. What do I do now?
Robot: Now toast 4 bread rolls cut side down on the griddle pan for 1 minute and set them aside. Then cut the ends off 1 large aubergine and slice the middle section into four 2cm thick slices using a knife. Take 1 tomato and do the same thing, slicing into four before setting it to the side.
User: The bread rolls are toasted and I have cut up the aubergine, what next?
Robot: Next, use a pastry brush to brush the aubergine slices on both sides with 11ml of olive oil and sprinkle them with cumin and coriander. Place them on the griddle pan for 4-5 minutes, turning over to cook for another 4-5 on the other side until softened and slightly charred. 
User: I have cooked the aubergine slices, what next? 
Robot: Next, heat another 11ml of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Finely slice 1 red onion and deseed and finely slice 1 small red pepper and 1 small yellow pepper using a knife. Stir fry these in the pan for 8-10 minutes or until softened and lightly browned. Stir in 22ml of red wine vinegar and 15ml of soft light brown sugar and season with salt and pepper. Cook for a few more seconds stirring constantly.
User: I’ve stir fried those vegetables, what is the next thing I need to do?
Robot: Now place the four bases of the bread rolls between four plates and top each with a small handful of rocket and a slice of tomato. Divide the pepper mixture between the rolls and top each with a slice of the aubergine. Spoon some avocado mayo on top, garnish with a few sprigs of coriander and cover with the tops of the rolls. Enjoy.
