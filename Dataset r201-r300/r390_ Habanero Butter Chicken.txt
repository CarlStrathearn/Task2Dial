User: I would like to make Habanero Butter Chicken.
Robot: First, in a saute pan, melt one and a half sticks of butter. Using a knife, cut 3-4 habaneros in half and put in the butter along with half or a whole onion, chopped into small pieces using a knife. Simmer on medium heat for 10-15 minutes. Once finished remove and dispose of the peppers.
User: I have simmered the peppers and onions on medium heat in the butter. The peppers have been thrown away, what now?
Robot: Now, place 6 chicken breasts in an ovenproof dish and pour the butter and onions over it, saving a little for the rice. 
User: The chicken is in a dish and I have  poured the butter and onions over it. What next?
Robot: Next, lightly drizzle 30ml of honey over the chicken and sprinkle 15ml of brown sugar on top. Next, mince 2-3 cloves of garlic with a garlic crusher and sprinkle this over the chicken along with some basil. 
User: I have sprinkled those ingredients over the chicken, what is next?
Robot: Next, slice 3-4 roma tomatoes using a knife and place these over the chicken with a sprinkle of salt and pepper on top. Bake this at 180ºC for 30-45 minutes. You could also spoon some of the sauce at the bottom of the dish and over the chicken halfway through cooking.
