User: I would like to make perfect French Side Salad.
Robot: Firstly, using a knife, finely slice 6 peeled shallots and place in a small dish. 
User: Okay, I have sliced and placed the shallots, what next?
Robot: Next, cover the shallots with white wine vinegar and allow this to sit for 10-15 minutes. 
User: I have soaked the shallots, what do I do now?
Robot: Now, with 1 large curly endive, pull all of the dark green leaves off and discard. Then cut or break off the remaining leaves. Place the endive leaves, 1 bunch of fresh chives, a handful of chervil, in a colander and wash in cold water. Use a salad spinner or a cloth to dry and place in a large salad bowl.
User: I have washed and dried the leaves, what is the next step?
Robot: Next, bring a pot of water to boil and add in 2 handfuls of slender green beans, allowing to cook for 8 minutes. Once done, drain, and allow these to cool.
User: The green beans have finished cooking and are now cooled, what next?
Robot: Next, add the beans to the salad leaves. Then, remove the outer leaves of two heads of boston lettuce. Wash these in a colander and then cut them into eight pieces. Add these to the bowl too along with the shallots soaking in the vinegar. 
User: I have added the green beans and the lettuce to the salad bowl. What now?
Robot: Now we will make the dressing. Put 60ml of the leftover vinegar which the shallots were soaking in, into a medium sized bowl, and add 15g of Dijon mustard. Next, using a knife, finely chop 2 peeled cloves of garlic and add these to the bowl along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add 60ml of extra virgin olive oil and whisk these ingredients until the dressing emulsifies.
User: I have made the dressing, what is next?
Robot: Add the dressing to the salad, toss and serve. Enjoy!
