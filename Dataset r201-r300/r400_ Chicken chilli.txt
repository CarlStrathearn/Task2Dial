User: I would like to make chicken chilli. 
Robot: First heat 30ml of olive oil in a saucepan. Slice 1 red onion using a knife and gently fry for 10 minutes or until soft.
User: I have  fried the onion, what next?
Robot: Next, use a knife to chop and add in 2 finely chopped cloves of garlic, 1 tsp of dried oregano, 1 bay leaf, 1 tsp of ground cumin, a sprinkle of chilli powder to taste, and 1 tsp of smoked paprika. Finely chop a bunch of coriander stalks and roughly chop the leaves. Add this to the pan with the rest of the ingredients, continuing to cook on a low heat for a minute.
User: I have  added those ingredients to the pan and cooked them, what do I do now?
Robot: Now, remove the skin and bones from 4 chicken thighs and cut them into chunks using a knife. Add these to the pan. Drain and rinse 2 400g tins of kidney beans and add these to the pan along with 250g of passata and 200ml of chicken stock. Add in 1 tsp of cider vinegar and sea salt and bring this to the boil.
User: I have  added the chicken and other ingredients and brought them to the boil, what is the next step?
Robot: Next reduce the heat and cook gently for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Cook your rice with enough water while you wait. Stir in 2-3 squares of dark chocolate into the pan and cook for another 5 minutes. 
User: I have  cooked the ingredients and added in the chocolate. What’s next?
Robot: Next taste and season with salt and pepper, scatter over the coriander leaves and serve with the rice, sliced avocado and a dollop of sour cream. Enjoy.
