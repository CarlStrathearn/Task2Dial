User: I would like to make cannellini beans two ways.
Robot: First heat 45ml of oil in a frying pan. Chop and peel using a knife and a peeler 1 red onion, 1 garlic clove, 1 celery stick and 1 carrot. Add these to the frying pan and season with 1 tsp of sea salt and fry gently for 10-15 minutes until soft.
User: I have  fried the vegetables until they are soft, what next?
Robot: Next stir in 400g of chopped tomatoes and two 400g tins of cannellini beans both drained and rinsed using a colander. Add a splash of red wine and a sprig of thyme, and season with sugar and black pepper before bringing to boil and simmering for 10 minutes. Stir as it simmers until the beans have softened.
User: I have  cooked the beans after adding those other ingredients. What is the next thing to do?
Robot: Next preheat the oven to 200ºC and pierce 2 baking potatoes several times with a skewer. Place them on a baking tray and once the oven is heated, bake for 60 minutes or until cooked through. 
User: The baked potatoes are cooked through, what now?
Robot: Now transfer them to serving plates and cut across the centre of each with a knife. There are two ways of making the potatoes. For the first one add a quarter of the beans to each potato and finish with 30g of goats cheese and a sprinkle of ground pepper. 
User: What is the other way?
Robot: The other way is Tuscan bean gratin. Keep the oven at 200ºC. Using a blender, blend a slice of bread into breadcrumbs. Mix them with 20g of parsley chopped with a knife, 1 finely chopped garlic clove, and 25g of coarsely grated parmesan. 
User: I have  prepared the breadcrumb mixture, what comes next?
Robot:Put the beans in an ovenproof dish and top with this breadcrumb mixture. Drizzle with olive oil and bake for 20-30 minutes, served with a green salad.
