User: I would like to make easy chicken tacos.
Robot: First, we need to make the marinade. In a large bowl, add 2 crushed cloves of garlic using a garlic press. Using a grater add the zest from 1 orange and 2 limes. Then cut with a knife and squeeze the juices in as well. Next, add 30ml of mexican hot chilli sauce, 30ml of tomato puree, 1 tsp of dried oregano, 1 tsp of ground cumin, 1 tsp of flaked sea salt, and 1 tsp of ground black pepper. 
User: All of those ingredients have been added to the bowl, what should I do next?
Robot: Next, mix the ingredients together well and add in 6 boneless skinless chicken thigh fillets. Turn them several times until they are well coated and cover the bowl, refrigerating for 30-60 minutes. 
User: I have marinated the chicken in the refrigerator. What next?
Robot: Next, preheat the oven to 220ºC. Line a large baking tray with baking paper and place the chicken on the tray. Brush the chicken generously with more of the marinade and roast the chicken for 20-25 minutes. 
User: The chicken is cooked, what now?
Robot: Now, make the pickled red onion. Start by finely slicing the onion with a knife, then place in a heatproof bowl and cover it with freshly boiled water, leave this to stand for 10 minutes. 
User: The onion has finished standing in the boiling water, next up?
Robot: Next, drain the water well and stir in 15ml of white or red wine vinegar and 15 g of caster sugar. Leave this to stand again for another 10 minutes before draining and set aside. 
User: I have served the pickled red onion, what now?
Robot: Now, transfer the chicken to a board and tear it into pieces with two forks. Serve by placing the chicken on 4 corn tortillas. Top with lettuce and avocado, finely chopped with a knife, the pickled onions, and a dollop of sour cream and enjoy.
