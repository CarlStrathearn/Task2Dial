User: I would like to make ceviche de pescado.
Robot: First use a knife to cut 1.1kg of orange roughy fish into very small cubes, approximately 6mm. 
User: I have chopped the fish into small pieces, what do I do next?
Robot: Next sprinkle 15g of salt on top of the fix and spread well using your hands. Place this into a plate or bowl and refrigerate for 4-8 hours. 
User: I have mixed the salt in and it has been refrigerated. What is the next step?
Robot: Next, juice 10-12 limes by cutting them in half with a knife and squeezing the juice. Use a hand juicer to get the most of the lime. Add the lime juice to the bowl with the fish and mix it well using a spoon.

Robot: Now place the bowl back into the refrigerator to marinade for another 4-8 hours.

Robot: Next serve this along with slices of avocados and tostadas and enjoy.
