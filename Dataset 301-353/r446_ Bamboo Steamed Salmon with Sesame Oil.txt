User: I would like to make Bamboo Steamed Salmon with Sesame Oil.
Robot: First, rinse 2 salmon fillets and pat them dry. Drizzle the salmon with 30ml of soy sauce and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Place 2 scallions, sliced with a knife, and 4 slices of ginger onto the fillets. 
User: I have washed the salmon and drizzled on the other ingredients, what now?
Robot: Now, cut a lemon in half using a knife and then cut one half into thin slices. Use one section of a bamboo steamer and place some cabbage, butter lettuce, or banana leaf down on the steamer and lay the fish on top. Place the sliced lemon on top of the fish and squeeze the juice from the remaining half over the top.
User: I have placed the salmon in the steamer and prepared it, what is next?
Robot: Next, steam the fish for 8-10 minutes by placing the bamboo steamer over boiling water in a wok. Once done, remove from the heat and drizzle with 2 tsp of sesame oil over the fillets. Serve hot over rice, bok choy, or noodles and enjoy.
