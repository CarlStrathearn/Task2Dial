User: I would like to make Mona of Easter.
Robot: First, dilute 30g of baker's yeast with some water and let it rest. Meanwhile, grate the peel from two oranges and set it aside. 
User: I have started the yeast and grated the orange peel, what now?
Robot: Now, in a bowl beat 6 eggs with a fork together with 70g of sugar powder and a pinch of salt for 4-5 minutes until it turns a whitish colour. Continue stirring and add 100ml of oil, and 100ml of milk. Then add 500g of flour and begin to mix by hand. Add the yeast and the orange peel and continue mixing to form a mass.
User: I have mixed the ingredients together, what next?
Robot: Next, knead the dough for 5 minutes and allow it to stand for 120 minutes at room temperature, covered with a cloth. Once rested, take it from the bowl and fold onto a counter, rolling in two or three layers to remove any air. Then take small balls of dough of 100g each and stretch them forming three cords, join them at the end and braid the dough by tying shoelaces. 
User: The dough has rested and has been separated and shaped, what now?
Robot: When finished braiding leave an opening at one end. Put the dough on a plate of oven braids and drizzle each of the pieces with beaten egg and sprinkle them with sugar. Place in the oven at 170ºC for 20-25 minutes. Afterwards, decorate with the candies and enjoy.
