User: I would like to make Moussaka Mediterraneo.
Robot: Using a knife, finely dice 2 large spanish onions. Place these in a large pan and lightly sweat, and caramelize the onions. 
User: I have caramelized the onions, what now?
Robot: Now add in 900g of your chosen ground meat, mixing and breaking it up until it cooks through. Next add to the pan 2 tsp of sea salt, 2 tsp of ground cinnamon, 2 tsp of sugar, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Using a knife peel and dice 5 large tomatoes, before adding them to the pan with the other ingredients. Mix them together well until combined. 
User: I have combined the ingredients in the pan, what next?
Robot: Next, add 240ml of red wine and reduce over a medium heat until the meat sauce is almost dry. Then add 45g of flat leaf parsley chopped using a knife. Then, remove from the heat and set the pan aside. 
User: I have reduced the sauce and added in the parsley. What is the next step?
Robot: Next, preheat your oven to 200ºC. Cut 1 500-900g eggplant into 1cm sleeves using a knife. Brush them with olive oil using a cooking brush. Grill the slices of eggplant until partially cooked then set them aside.
User: I have grilled the eggplant, now what?
Robot: Now we will make the white sauce. Start by heating a saucepan over a low flame and adding in 600ml of milk. While the milk heats, melt 60g of butter in a separate saucepan. 
User: The milk is heating and I have melted the butter in the other saucepan, what now?
Robot: Now, gradually add 60g of flour to the butter. Whisk this constantly to blend. Once blended, gradually pour the hot milk into the butter and flour mixture. Keep whisking quickly, avoiding lumps in the sauce. Turn the heat to a medium and bring the mixture to a boil.
User: The white sauce is now boiling after combining the pans, what do I do now?
Robot: Now add some salt and pepper, with a pinch of grated nutmeg, allowing this to combine. Turn the heat down to a medium low. In a separate bowl, beat 2 fresh eggs with a fork, slowly tempering them by gradually pouring in 120ml of the white sauce while whisking. Pour the tempered eggs into the white sauce and whisk vigorously, avoiding bringing the pot to boil, adding 120g of parmesan cheese. 
User: I have added in the other ingredients, including the eggs I tempered. What now?
Robot: Now, cover the bottom of a 23x33cm pan with eggplant sleeves. Spoon half of the meat sauce over the eggplant. Do this again, using the other half of the meat sauce. Then pour the white sauce all over the meat sauce, covering the dish. 
User: I have layered the eggplant and the sauces together, what’s next?
Robot: Next, sprinkle some extra grated cheese and bake in the oven for 45 minutes. Once finished, serve and enjoy. 
User: Thanks for helping me make Moussaka Mediterraneo.
