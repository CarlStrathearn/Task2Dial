User: I would like to make Peruvian Roast Chicken.
Robot: Start by adding 60g of mint leaves, 8 garlic cloves, 45ml of olive oil, 15g of salt, 15g of ground cumin, 15g of sugar, 2 tsp of smoked paprika, 2 tsp of dried oregano, 2 tsp of lime zest grated using a grater, 60g of lime juice, and 1 tsp of minced jalapeno minced with a garlic crusher to the bowl of a food processor. Once added, blend to a smooth paste. 
User: I have blended together all of those ingredients, what next?
Robot: Next, loosen the skin on the chicken by sliding your fingers underneath the breasts and thighs. Using your fingers spread half of the paste under the skin and then the remaining paste on the outside of the skin.
User: The paste has now been applied to the chicken, what do I do now?
Robot: Now put the chicken in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Leave it to sit at room temperature for 2 hours, or refrigerate for 6-24 hours. 
User: The chicken has finished standing, what now?
Robot: Now, adjust the oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 170ºC. Place a vertical roaster on the roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. Then slide the chicken on it until the drumsticks just touch the pan, roasting until the skin is golden and the breast is 60ºC read from a meat thermometer. This should take about 50-60 minutes. Then remove the pan from the oven.
User: I have rosated the chicken for about an hour, what next?
Robot: Now, raise the oven temperature to 260ºC. Once reached, place the chicken back into the oven with 240ml of water added to the roasting pan, roasting for a further 20 minutes until the skin is crispy and the breast registers 80ºC.
User: The chicken has been roasted further, what comes now?
Robot: Remove the pan from the oven and let the chicken rest vertically for 15 minutes. Remove from the rack, carve, serve and enjoy. 
User: Thanks for helping me make Peruvian Roast Chicken.
