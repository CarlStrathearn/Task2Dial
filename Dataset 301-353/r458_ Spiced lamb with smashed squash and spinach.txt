With a knife, finely chop half of a red chilli before adding to the bowl. Add some salt and pepper and leave this to marinate for 5-10 minutes. 
User: I have marinated the lamb in a bowl, what now?
Robot: Now, cook 400g of butternut squash in a saucepan with boiling water for 10 minutes. Drain thoroughly and toss with 30ml of olive oil, a sprinkle of dried chilli flakes, and some salt and pepper. Return this to the pan and mash together well, adding a squeeze of lemon juice. 
User: The squash has been cooked and mashed together with the other ingredients, what next?

User: I have cooked the lamb, now what?
Robot: Now add 100g of spinach leaves, chopped with a knife, to the pan. Toss lightly using tongs for a few seconds. Divide the squash and spinach between two warmed plates and top with the lamb cutlets and any juices. Garnish with mint and olive oil and enjoy.
