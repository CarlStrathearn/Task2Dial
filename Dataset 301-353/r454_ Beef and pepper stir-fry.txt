User: I would like to make Beef and Pepper Stir-Fry.
Robot: First in a bowl add 60ml of soy sauce, 60ml of sweet chilli sauce, 1 clove of garlic crushed with the side of a knife, 1 tsp of chinese five spice powder, 1 tsp of light muscovado sugar, and the juice from 1 large lime. Mix these ingredients together well. 
User: I have mixed those ingredients together, what do I do next?
Robot: Next using a meat mallet bash two 200g trimmed rump steaks to make them a little thinner. Sit them in a large dish and spoon over 45ml of the pre-prepared marinade and leave to marinate while you cook the noodles. 
User: I have prepared the meat and marinated in a bowl, what next?
Robot: Next heat 30ml of oil over a medium-high heat in a large non-stick frying pan. Season the steaks with salt and pepper and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side. Once fried, transfer them to a warmed plate and allow them to rest. 
User: I have fried the beef steaks, what now?
Robot: Now wipe the pan with kitchen paper and add oil. Fry 2 red peppers, deseeded and chopped with a knife. Thinly slice one onion using a knife and add this to the pan to fry too, frying for 3-4 minutes over high heat. Separate the green and white parts of half a head of chinese leaf and add in the white parts to the pan for another minute. 
User: I have pan fried the other vegetables, what do I do now?
Robot: Add the remaining marinade to the pan along with 150g of fine egg noodles. Toss this together until coated and then add the green parts of the chinese leaves. Chop a bunch of coriander with a knife and add this to the pan with some salt and pepper to season. Continue to toss until everything is mixed together. 
User: I have mixed together all of the ingredients, now what?
Robot: Divide the noodles among four plates and thinly slice the steaks, placing these on top of the noodles. Drizzle with the rest of the steak juices and garnish with coriander. Serve and enjoy.
