Robot: First, preheat the oven to 180ºC. Then, line a baking sheet with tin foil and drizzle it with canola oil. Place 450g of fresh polish sausage on the baking sheet and cook for 35-40 minutes.
User: I have  cooked the sausage, what now?
Robot: Now fry 6 slices of bacon in a dutch oven until they are crispy. Then, remove from the pan and place on a plate, lined with paper towels, to drain. In the same pan add 15g of butter. Dice 1 large onion using a knife and add this to the pan with the bacon grease and butter. Fry until the onions are tender and transparent, then remove and set aside.
User: The bacon and the onions are both fried, what is next?
Robot: Add 225g of smoked sausage to the same pan and cook for 20 minutes. When both sausages are finished cooking add the polish sausage to the pan.
User: The sausages are done and are now both frying in the pan, now what?
Robot: Now add 1 large drained can of sauerkraut and half a head of fresh cabbage sliced thinly with a knife to the pan. In a food processor, chop 450g of canned stewed tomatoes. Add these together with 225 ml of canned tomato sauce, a sprinkle of caraway seed, 60g of brown sugar and the bacon to the pan.
User: I have  added the rest of the ingredients to the pan, what do I do now?
Robot: Now mix it well together using a spatula or wooden spoon and cook over low-medium heat for 60 minutes or until the sauerkraut is tender. Stir often to avoid the bottom burning.
