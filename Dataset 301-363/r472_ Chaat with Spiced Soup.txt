User: I would like to make Chaat with Spiced Soup.
Robot: First soak 120g of dried whole green peas for 6-8 hours in cold water. Once done, rinse well and put it in an instant pot with 950ml of water, closing the lid and pushing the “bean” preset mode. Let the Instant Pot cook and cool completely on its own and open when the valve drops. 
User: I’ve soaked and cooked the peas, what now?
Robot: Now set the Instant Pot to saute mode and add 45g of apple butter, 1 tsp of jeera, 1 tsp of garam masala, 15g of ginger, 15g of garlic, 30g of sugar, the juice from half a lemon, 1 tsp of turmeric, salt, oil, and red chilli powder. 
User: I’ve added the other ingredients, what is the next step?
Robot: The next step is to let the mixture boil for about 5 minutes and remove from the heat allowing it to cool. Serve and enjoy. 
User: Thanks for helping me make Chaat with Spiced Soup.
