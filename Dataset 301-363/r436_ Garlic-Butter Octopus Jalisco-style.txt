User: I would like to make Garlic-Butter Octopus Jalisco-Style. 
Robot: First, preheat the grill to a medium-high heat. Rinse and cut 900g of octopus into small bite sized pieces, place them into a medium bowl. 
User: I have washed and cut the octopus. What now?
Robot: Now slice 8 cloves of garlic with a knife and add them into a medium bowl with the octopus. Sprinkle it with salt and pepper. 
User: I have added the garlic, and seasoned the octopus, what comes next?
Robot: Next, tear a sheet of tin foil 90cm in length, folding in half. Place the octopus and the garlic on one side of the foil. Then, slice 45g of butter and spread it evenly on the top of the octopus and garlic, folding the empty half of the tin foil over the top and crimping the edges to seal. Poke a small hole in the top of the foil. 
User: I have folded the octopus up in the tin foil with the butter and garlic, what now?
Robot: Now place the foil package on the grill and close the lid, grilling for 6 minutes. Turn it over with tongs for another 6 minutes. Once done, remove from the grill, serve and enjoy. 
User: Thanks for helping me make Garlic-Butter Octopus Jalisco-Style.
