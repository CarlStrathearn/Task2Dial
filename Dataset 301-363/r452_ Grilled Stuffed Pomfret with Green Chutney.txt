User: I would like to make Grilled Stuffed Pomfret with Green Chutney
Robot: Trim the fins and the tail of 1 whole pomfret fish. Then slit the stomach horizontally with a knife, carefully gutting the fish and washing the cavity thoroughly. With a knife continue to slit more down to the tail end and slowly ease away the back bone from the flesh. Turn the fish over and repeat the process, this time from the tail end. Gently snap the bone from the head and tail side and carefully remove it, washing again. 
User: I have prepared the pomfret fish, what now?
Robot: Now marinate the fish with the juice of half a lemon, and some salt and pepper to taste. Leave to marinade for at least 30 minutes.  
User: I have marinaded the fish and placed it into the refrigerator, what next?
Robot: Next, add a handful of roasted groundnuts and cumin seeds to a blender along with a 5cm piece of ginger, previously sliced with a knife; 1 medium red onion chopped with a knife, and 2 green chillies. Blend these ingredients to a coarse paste. 
User: The ingredients have been blended to a coarse paste, now what?
Robot: Add in 360g of coriander leaves and 120g of mint leaves, alongwith the juice from half a lemon and 30ml of water. Blend these further into a coarse paste. Place this into a bowl and add some salt and lemon to taste. 
User: I have added the ingredients to the paste and moved it into a bowl. What is the next step?
Robot: The next step is to stuff the fish with the green chutney paste, genty coating both sides of the fish with the same paste. Drizzle 15ml of oil over the top and broil for 6-7 minutes on each side in an oven safe baking tray. 
User: I stuffed and covered the fish in the chutney, and broiled it. What now?
Robot: Now, when the fish is cooked take it out of the oven and allow it to cool. Serve and enjoy the fish with some extra green chutney as an appetizer or as a meal with sides of your choice.
