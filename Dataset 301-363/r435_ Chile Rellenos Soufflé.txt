User: I would like to make Chile Rellenos Souffle.
Robot: First, preheat the oven to 200ºC. Spray the bottom of a 23x23xm baking dish with cooking oil.
User: The oven is ready and I have prepared the dish, what now?
Robot: Pour 200ml of canned green chile enchilada sauce into the bottom of the baking dish. Pour the remaining 85ml of sauce into a small microwavable jug. 
User: I have poured in the sauce to the dish and the jug, what next?
Robot: In a bowl separate 4 large eggs, removing the yolks into a different bowl. Beat the egg whites together using a fork along with a dash of salt until soft peaks form. In the other bowl whisk the yolks together with 15g of flour for 1 minutes before folding the egg yolks thoroughly into the egg whites. 
User: I have folded the eggs together, what do I do now?
Robot: Now spread half of the egg mixture over the green enchilada sauce in the baking fish, spreading it evenly. Then take one 200g can of whole green chillies and cut each chilli lengthwise with a knife. Spread the chilli open and arrange them over the egg mixture in the pan. 
User: I have arranged the chillies over the egg mixture, what is the next step?
Robot: The next step is to arrange 100g of monterey jack cheese, thinly sliced, over the chillies and top with the remaining egg mixture, spreading evenly. Bake this for 20 minutes until golden brown on top, then serve with the remaining enchilada sauce in the jug and enjoy
