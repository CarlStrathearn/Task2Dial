User: I would like to make Pressure Cooker Lamb Karahi with New Potatoes
Robot: First, put a 1kg lamb leg in a bowl. In a mini processor add 6 peeled cloves of garlic, 5cm of fresh root ginger, 1 tsp of salt, a sprinkle of black pepper and 15ml of vegetable oil. Pulse this into a paste. Add this paste to the lamb and stir it to coat, allowing this to marinate for at least an hour or overnight in the fridge. 
User: I have marinated the lamb, what now?
Robot: Now, heat 45ml of the oil in a pressure cooker over a medium-high heat. Add the lamb and fry it for 5 minutes or until it browns. 
User: The lamb looks cooked, what comes next?
Robot: Next, finely chop one large onion using a knife. Add this to the pressure cooker and fry for 4-5 minutes or until softened. Then add 1 tsp of chilli powder, 2 tsp of ground coriander, 1 tsp of turmeric, 1 tsp of cumin, a sprinkle of garam masala and a sprinkle of ground fenugreek to the pressure cooker. Stir for 2-3 until the lamb is well coated and fragrant. 
User: I have added in the onion and the spices, what do I do next? 
Robot: Add 500g of baby new potatoes, 400ml of water along with one whole green chilli, finely sliced with a knife to the pressure cooker. Stir together before covering with a lid and placing over a high heat until it reaches pressure. Reduce the heat and cook for 20 minutes.
User: The pressure cooker has been going for 20 minutes, what now?
Robot: Now remove the pressure cooker from the heat and leave to depressurise. Remove the lid and stir 90g of greek style yoghurt through the spice and juices. 
User: I have stirred in the yoghurt, what now?
Robot: Now bring rice to a boil and serve when cooked. Serve the rice with the lamb, another sliced green chilli, some ginger, and fresh coriander to garnish. Enjoy.
