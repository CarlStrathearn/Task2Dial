User: I would like to make Korean fried chicken. 
Robot: Start by brining the chicken. Dissolve 100g of sugar and 75g of sea salt in 200ml of hot water. Mix in 1L of cold water into the brine solution and submerge 8-10 chicken pieces with the bones and skin removed. Leave this to stand covered for 2 hours, while waiting, prepare to make the sauces.
User: I prepared the brine and left the chicken to soak. What do I need to do to make the sauces?
Robot: To make the sweet soy sauce prepare a saucepan. Add 100ml of soy sauce, 25ml of mirin, 25ml of rice wine vinegar, 2cm of grated fresh root ginger, 2 cloves of garlic and 50g of brown sugar. Stir these together over a low heat until the sugar dissolves and simmer this for 2 minutes. Taste and add salt if necessary. Add sesame oil to taste and in a small bowl whisk 1 tsp of cornflour with some cold water until you have a smooth but runny paste. Whisk into the sauce over a low heat until it thickens slightly then set aside. 
User: I have stirred in the ingredients, what is the next step?
Robot: Now make the chilli sauce. In a bowl whisk together 30ml of korean chilli paste, 15ml of hot sauce, 1 tsp of rice wine vinegar, 15ml of honey and a few drops of sesame oil. Taste and add salt if needed and thin with some water if needed. 
User: I have made the chilli sauce. What do I do now?
Robot: Cook the chicken by draining and rinsing the brinded chicken thoroughly and pat dry. Then whisk 30g of flour, 15g of cornflour, 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of baking powder. Dust the chicken with this mixture and pat off any excess. Leave this to stand while you make the batter. 
User: I have dusted the chicken, what do I do next?
Robot: Next, whisk together 125g of flour, 25g of cornflour, a pinch of salt and baking powder. Then whisk in 100ml of vodka and 100ml of cold water. The texture should be quite thin like double cream. 
User: I have prepared the batter, what next?
Robot: Add some oil to your fryer, large saucepan, or wok. Do not fill the oil beyond halfway and heat to 160ºC. Next, dip the chicken pieces in the batter one at a time. Allow any excess to drop over the bowl then slowly lower into the hot oil, letting go when it is almost submerged. Fry for 8-10 minutes then drain and dry on kitchen paper. 
User: The chicken pieces have all been fried, is that it?
Robot: The chicken isn’t finished yet. Turn the heat up to 190ºC and fry the chicken for another 2 minutes or until it darkens. Remove to drain and dry on paper towels again and it should now be crispy. Serve with the premade sauces or paste over the pieces and enjoy.
