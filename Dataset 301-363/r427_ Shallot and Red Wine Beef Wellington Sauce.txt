User: I would like to make Shallot and Red Wine Beef Wellington Sauce.
Robot: To begin, add 60ml of oil into a medium-sized saucepan over high heat. Once hot, saute 225g of shallots, sliced with a knife, for about 3 minutes until they become golden brown. 
User: I have sautéed the mushrooms in the pan, what next?
Robot: Stir this in the pan using a wooden spoon while adding 1 clove of garlic, crushed in a garlic crusher. Then add a sprig of rosemary and some ground black pepper. Continue cooking for 3 more minutes, stirring often to keep the shallots from burning. 
User: The ingredients are cooking in the pan, what comes now?
Robot: Now, pour 75ml of balsamic vinegar into the pan and allow the mixture to cook until it evaporates and leaves behind a syrup. Then pour in 360ml of red wine and allow it to cook until it reduces by two thirds. 
User: I have cooked the vinegar into the pan and added the red wine. What now?
Robot: Now pour in 360ml of beef or chicken stock and bring the mixture to the boil. Then turn down the heat and simmer until it reduces by another two thirds, about 240ml. Once it reduces, remove the rosemary and the garlic. 
User: I have simmered the sauce until it has reduced and removed the rosemary and garlic, what is the next step?
Robot: The next step is to season with salt and whisk in 1 tsp of butter. Add any juices you may have from the steak you may be cooking and serve over the beef wellington and enjoy. 
User: Thanks for helping me make Shallot and Red Wine Beef Wellington Sauce.
