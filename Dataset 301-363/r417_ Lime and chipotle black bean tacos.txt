User: I would like to make lime and chipotle black bean tacos.
Robot: First to prepare the beans, heat a frying pan over medium heat. Add 2 cloves of garlic chopped finely with a knife along with some olive oil for frying. Cook for a minute or so until the edges of the garlic begin to brown.
User: I have fried the garlic, what now?
Robot: Now, add to the pan 1 tsp of ground cinnamon, 1 tsp of ground cumin, and 1 tsp of chipotle paste stirring with a wooden spoon for another minute, to gently toast the spices. Then add two 400g tins of black beans with the liquid and bring to a simmer, turning the heat down to cook for 10-15 minutes until the liquid thickens but the beans hold their shape. Season with salt and pepper and keep the pan warm.
User: I have added in the spices and cooked the beans. What should I do next?
Robot: Next, prepare the salsa. First chop 20 cherry tomatoes roughly on a big board using a knife. Chop half of a red chilli into fine pieces and pick leaves from a few sprigs of coriander. Pile these on top of the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Chop all of these together before scraping into a big bowl.
User: I have chopped those ingredients together for the salsa and added them to a big bowl. What now?
Robot: Now add juice from half of a lime and splash some olive oil, mixing all of the ingredients together with a spoom. Then set this aside for later. 
User: I have added the juice and the oil and given it a good mix. What’s the next step?
Robot: The next step is to prepare the guacamole. Deseed an avocado and scrape away from the skin with a spoon. In a small bowl mash this together with a fork adding salt and pepper, 1 chopped green chilli, and the juice from the other half of the lime. Set this aside.
User: I have finished the guacamole, what next?
Robot: Next, heat 8 tortillas by holding them with tongs over a flame on a gas hob. In a pan, fry 4 free-range eggs in a little oil. 
User: I have heated my tortillas and fried the eggs, now what?
Robot: Now fill the tortillas with the beans, salsa, guacamole, egg, a handful of grated cheese, some breakfast radishes chopped with a knife, and some chilli sauce and coriander. Serve these and enjoy. 
User: Thanks for helping me make Lime and Chipotle black bean tacos.
