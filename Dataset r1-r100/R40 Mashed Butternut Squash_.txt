User: I want to make Mashed Butternut Squash
Robot: Okay, let’s begin. Start by preheating the oven to 204º. Wash the surface of a squash and pat it dry using a kitchen towel. Then, place it on a rimmed baking sheet that is lined with aluminium foil. Bake the quash for about 1 hour and 30 minutes or until it becomes very soft and can be easily run by a skewer. Once it's baked, slice the squash lengthwise using a knife. Scoop out the seeds and discard them. Scrape the flesh of the squash using a spoon and place it into a large mixing bowl. 
User: The squash is now in a bowl, what comes next? 
Robot: Next, add 4 tablespoons of butter, ¼ cup of maple syrup, ½ teaspoon of salt and ¼ teaspoon of pepper into the bowl with the squash. Whip all ingredients together using an electric hand mixer until it's incorporated and smooth. Enjoy your meal.
User: Thank you.
