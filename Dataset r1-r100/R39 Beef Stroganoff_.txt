User: I want to make Beef Stroganoff
Robot: Okay, let’s begin. Start by prepping ingredients. Cut a 2 ½ pound sirloin steak lengthwise into 4 equal pieces using a knife and a cutting board. Make sure to trim off any excess fat. Use a fork to poke holes along the meat pieces and place them into a large baking dish. Coat both sides of the pieces with soy sauce and then cover the dish with plastic wrap. Place the dish in the fridge and allow the meat to marinate for at least 15 minutes or up to 2 hours. Next, clean and slice 2 pounds of white mushrooms using a knife and cutting board. Place the cut mushrooms into a microwave safe bowl and microwave the mushrooms on high power for about 10 minutes. This should leave the mushrooms reduced by half in volume and a little pool of mushroom water underneath them. Drain the mushrooms and add 1 chopped onion into the bowl and set this aside. Finally, combine 4 teaspoons of hot water, 2 tablespoons of dry mustard, 2 teaspoons of sugar and ½ teaspoon of ground pepper in a bowl using a whisk. Then, add 2 ½ cups of beef broth and ⅔ cup of white wine into the bowl, whisk together, and set this aside as well. This is the end of the prepping part. 
User: I have finished prepping, what comes next?
Robot: Now let’s make the pasta and the steak. For the pasta, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil in a large stockpot. Add in 2 pounds of egg noodles and 1 tablespoon of salt and cook them until they are al dente, this should take about 8 minutes. For the steak, heat up 3 tablespoons of canola oil in a dutch oven over medium-heat. Remove the steak from the fridge and pat the meat pieces dry using a towel. Season the steak lightly with pepper and cook in the dutch oven until it has browned on both sides. This should take about 8 minutes as well. Once both pasta and steak are done, drain and take it out of the dutch oven respectively and set them aside. 
User: The pasta and steak are ready, what do I do now? 
Robot: Now, let's make the sauce. Start by sauteing the reserved mushrooms and onions in the same dutch oven you cooked the steak in. Cook on high heat for about 8 minutes. Then, add 1 ½ tablespoons of flour and 1 ½ tablespoons of tomato paste to the dutch oven and stir using a wooden spoon or spatula with the mushrooms and onions until it's fully combined. Add in the reserved broth-wine-mustard-sugar mixture into the dutch oven and stir to combine. Cook all ingredients together until the sauce has thickened and reduced slightly. This should take about 8 minutes. 
User: The sauce is now done, what’s next? 
Robot: Next, cut the steaks into ¼-inch strips and add them into the dutch oven. Stir until the steak pieces warm up, this should take about 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let it rest for a moment before adding 1 cup of sour cream and ¼ cups of white wine into it. Now for serving, place the desired amount of pasta into a plate and top it with the sauce and steak. Sprinkle some fresh chopped parsley on top and enjoy your meal.
