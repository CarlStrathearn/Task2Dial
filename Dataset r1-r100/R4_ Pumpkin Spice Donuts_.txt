User: I want to make Pumpkin Spice Donut
Robot: Start by preheating the oven to 180°C and lightly grease the inside of a donut pan. Set this aside. 
User: I have turned on the oven, now what? 
Robot: Now pour ¾ cup canned pumpkin, ½ cup milk, ½ cup brown sugar, ⅓ cup vegetable oil, 1 egg and 1 ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract into a mixing bowl and combine the ingredients. Set this aside.
User: I have combined the ingredients, now what do I do? 
Robot: In another bowl pour 1 ¾ cups flour, 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder, ½ teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, ½ teaspoon nutmeg, ½ teaspoon allspice and 1/8 teaspoons ground cloves and mix together. 
User: I have combined these ingredients too, what's next? 
Robot: Start pouring the second mixture (dry ingredients) into the first one and combine with a spatula. When this is done, transfer half of the batter onto a large plastic or zipper bag and cut one of the bottom corners to make a piping bag. Use this to make the shape of the donuts. Make just enough to fit the donut pan and set the rest of the batter aside. 
User: I have made the donuts, what do I do now? 
Robot: Now bake the donuts for about 12-15 minutes, until they are golden brown. When they are done, transfer them onto a wire rack to let them cool for about 5 minutes. Keep doing this step until you are out of batter. 
User: I have baked and let all the donuts cool down, what do I do next?
Robot: Now let's make the coating. Mix ½ cup of melted butter, ⅔ cup of sugar and 1-2 tablespoons of cinnamon (to taste) in a bowl. Dip the donuts onto the mixture and enjoy your meal. 
User: Thank you.
