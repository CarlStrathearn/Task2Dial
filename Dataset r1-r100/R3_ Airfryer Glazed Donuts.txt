User: I would like to cook Airfryer Glazed Donuts
Robot: Let’s start with the dough. Put 3 cups of all-purpose flour, ¼  cup of sugar, ½ tablespoons of salt and 2 ½  teaspoons of instant yeast into a large bowl and mix until combined and a rough dough forms. 
User: Okay I have mixed the ingredients, now what? 
Robot: Put 1 cup of room temperature milk, 1 previously whisked egg and ¼ of melted unsalted butter into the dough and combine. When everything is combined, transfer it onto a surface to knead until it is smooth and elastic. Be sure to flour the surface so the dough doesn't stick to it. This process should take 5-10 minutes.
User: I have made the dough, what do I do now? 
Robot: Now let’s let the dough rise. Place it into a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. After roughly 1 hour transfer the dough onto a floured surface and roll it out until it's around ½ inches. 
User: I have rolled the dough, now what? 
Robot: Take a 3-inch round cutter and cut the donuts out, it should give you around 10 to 14 donuts. Then theake a 1-inch round cutter to remove the center of each donut. Transfer the donuts and donut holes to a tray covered with lightly-greased parchment paper. Then cover the donuts with greased plastic wrap and let them rise until they double their volume. This should be around 30 minutes. 
User: The donuts are now double their size, what do I do next? 
Robot: Spray the air fryer basket with oil spray. Transfer the donuts onto it one layer at a time, there shouldn’t be donuts on top of donuts. Spray the donuts with the same oil spray and fry for about 4-5 minutes at 350°F (180°C). Repeat with all the donuts.
