User: I want to make Better Potato Salad
Robot: Okay, let’s begin. Start by washing the potatoes and placing them together with 2 tablespoons of sea salt into a large stock pot. Fill the pot with water until the potatoes are submerged. Bring the potatoes to a boil over high heat and then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are starting to become tender, this should take 10-15 minutes. When the potatoes are ready, drain them using a colander and then place the colander into the empty pot. Cover the pot with a dish towel to create a steam chamber for the potatoes. Let the potatoes sit like this for about 15 minutes before removing them. There are steps to this recipe while the potatoes are steaming, let me know when you would like me to tell you the next steps.
