User: I want to make Nutella Cereal 
Robot: Okay, let’s begin. Start by preheating the oven at 176º and lining two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Then, in a large bowl mix together using a whisk 4 cups of all-purpose flour, ¾ cup of cocoa and 1 ½ teaspoons of salt. These will be your “dry ingredients” In a separate medium bowl, mix 3 eggs, ¾ of a cup of honey or agave syrup, 6 tablespoons of milk and 6 tablespoons of Nutella using a spoon or spatula. This should take about 2 minutes; these will be your “wet ingredients”. Pour half of the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and use a spatula to combine fully before pouring in the rest of the wet ingredients. Combine until a rough dough has formed.
User: A rough dough has formed, what do I do now? 
Robot: Now, dust your hands with some flour as you will be rolling the cereal balls. Take a piece of the dough and roll it into a long and thin strand as if you were making a snake. Then, pull off a small part of this strand and roll it into a ball-shape using your fingers. Remember you are making cereal balls, so the smaller you make them the better. Place the balls in rows on the baking sheet. When you have rolled all the balls, bake the cereal for 10 minutes. After that time, check that all balls are cooking thoroughly and use a spatula to unstick any balls that need it. Then, return the baking sheet to the oven and bake for a further 12-14 minutes until the balls are crunchy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Let them cool on a wire rack before serving and enjoy your meal.
User: Thank you.
