User: I want to make Sweet potato burritos
Robot: Okay, let’s begin. Start by rinsing 1 cup of dried balck beans and placing them in a saucepan. Cover them with water and soak overnight. The next day, drain the beans using a colander and return them to the saucepan. Pour in 3 cups of fresh water and bring them to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon of canola oil, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 bay leaf into the bean saucepan and cook for about 90 minutes over low heat. When they are done, remove from the heat and drain any excess water. Remove the bay leaf and set the beans aside. If you wish, there are steps to take while the beans are cooking, let me know when you would like me to tell you about them. 
User: The beans are cooking, what can I do in the meantime? 
Robot: In the meantime, you can make the sweet potatoes and the tomato salsa. For the sweet potatoes, start by peeling and slicing 2 sweet potatoes using a knife and a cutting board. Dice them into small cubes and place them into a large saucepan. Add water as needed and bring them to a boil over high heat. Then, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes or until they are tender. Drain them and set them aside. For the tomato salsa core and seed 2 large tomatoes and dice them into small pieces using the knife and cutting board. Also, chop half a red onion and 2 teaspoons of fresh cilantro. Place them into a medium bowl together with 1⁄2 tablespoon of fresh squeezed lime juice, ½ tablespoon of fresh squeezed lemon juice and ½ a teaspoon of kosher salt. Stir the ingredients together using a wooden spoon and set it aside. 
User: The potatoes, beans and salsa are done, what do I do now? 
Robot: Now let’s move on to the burrito filling. Start by chopping 1 red onion, 3 garlic cloves, 1 tomato, 1 red bell pepper and 1 cup of kale or spinach using a knife and cutting board. Then, heat up 2 teaspoons of canola oil on a large skillet until it shimmers. Add the onion and garlic into the skillet and saute until they are soft, which should take about 5 minutes. Add the reserved sweet potatoes, the tomato, the red bell pepper and ½ a teaspoon of chili powder into the skillet. Saute the ingredients and mash half of the sweet potatoes using a wooden spoon. Cook until it's well combined, this should take 3 minutes. Then, add 2 cups of the reserved black beans, the chopped kale or spinach and 1 tablespoon of lime juice into the skillet. Stir using a wooden spoon or spatula until combined. FInally, add ½ a teaspoon of salt and ¼ of a teaspoon of pepper to the mixture and combine. When this is done, remove from the heat. 
User: The burrito filling is done, what now?
Robot: Now let’s assemble the burrito. Place a tortilla and spoon the sweet potato mixture, the salsa and avocado slices into it. Top with cheese and/or sour cream as desired and roll the tortilla up into a burrito. Repeat this step with 7 more tortillas or until you use all the filling and enjoy your meal.
