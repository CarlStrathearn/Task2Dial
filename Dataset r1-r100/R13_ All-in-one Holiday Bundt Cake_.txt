User: I want to make an all-in-one holiday bundt cake 
Robot: Okay let's begin. For this recipe you will need butter at room temperature, so if you don’t have it be sure to leave 1 ¼ sticks of butter out for a couple hours then come back to do this recipe. 
User: I have room temperature butter, what do I do?
Robot: Now preheat the oven at 180º. Using your hand, take 1-2 tablespoons of butter and grease a large Bundt. When it has been greased, take 1 teaspoon of flour and dust it over the butter.
User: I have greased the Bundt, what’s next?
Robot: Next, put 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, ½ teaspoon baking soda, 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon grated nutmeg, 1 teaspoon ginger powder and pinch salt into a medium bowl and using a whisk or a spatula mix together until they are well combined. 
User: I have combined the ingredients, what do I do now?
Robot: Now put the rest of the butter, 1 cup granulated sugar and ½ cup packed light brown sugar into a large bowl. Blend them together using a hand mixer at medium speed until the mixture starts looking fluffy. This should take around 3 minutes. 
User: Everything is now blended, what comes next?
Robot: Take 2 large eggs and 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and add them to the mixture you just whisked. Take the hand mixer and whisk until it’s combined. This should take another 2 minutes. When it’s done, add 1 ¼ cup of canned unsweetened pumpkin purée to the bowl and keep blending with the hand mixer on medium speed until well combined. 
User: All the ingredients are mixed, what should I do now?
Robot: Now, using a kitchen knife and a cutting board peel, core and chop 1 large apple. On the same board, halve and chop 1 cup of cranberries and 1 cup of pecans. Take another bowl and add the flour mixture and the chopped ingredients. Use a spatula to stir all the ingredients until they are well combined. Then, pour the batter into the Bundt pan and smooth the top with the spatula. Put the Bundt into the oven and bake for 60-70 minutes. When it’s done, remove the Bundt from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes before removing the cake from the pan. Then, let it cool down for 3-4 hours before serving. The next step is to make the icing, let me know when you would like me to tell you the steps. 
User: The cake is now cooling down. How do I make the icing?
Robot: To make the icing, start by using a colander to sift 6 tablespoons of confection’s sugar into a small bowl. Then, use a spatula to stir the sugar and, slowly, start adding 2 tablespoons of maple syrup until the icing drips off the tip of the spatula. 
User: The mixture is now done, what comes next?
Robot: Wait until the cake is completely cooled and put it on wax paper. Drizzle the icing on top of the cake and let it harden for a few minutes. Enjoy your meal!
User: Thank you.
