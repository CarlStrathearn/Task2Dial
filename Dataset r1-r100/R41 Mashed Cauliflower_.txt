User: I want to make Mashed Cauliflower
Robot: Okay, let’s begin. Start by bringing 1 quart of water to boil in a large stock pot. Wash 1 head of a cauliflower and then, using a knife and a cutting board, cut it into small pieces. Place them into the stock pot and cook for 8-10 minutes or until it's soft. Drain the cauliflower using a salad spinner and place it into the bowl of a food processor. 
User: The cauliflower is ready, what do I do now? 
Robot: Now add ¼ cup of parmesan cheese, 3 tablespoons of  butter, 1 tablespoon of cream cheese, 2 cloves of minced garlic, ½ teaspoon of salt and ¼ teaspoon of pepper into the food processor bowl. Process all ingredients together until they are smooth. Enjoy your meal.
