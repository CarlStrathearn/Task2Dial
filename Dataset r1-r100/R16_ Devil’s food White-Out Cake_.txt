User: I want to make Devil’s food White-Out Cake. 
Robot: Okay, let’s begin. Start by preheating the oven at 180º and buttering two 8-inch round cake pans with 2 tablespoons of butter. Lightly dust the buttered pan with 1 tablespoon of flour. Remove any excess flour by tapping the cake pan over the sink and then cover with parchment paper. 
User: I have prepared the cake pan, what do I do now? 
Robot: Now melt 2 ounces of bittersweet chocolate in your microwave or using a double boiler if you prefer. Set this aside. Take a medium bowl and add 1 ⅓ cups of all-purpose flour, ½ cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, ¾ teaspoon of baking soda, ½ teaspoon of baking powder and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Combine it all together using a spatula or wooden spoon and set it aside as well. These will be your “dry ingredients”.
User: I have prepared the mixture, what’s next? 
Robot: Next, place 10 tablespoons (1 ¼ sticks) of unsalted butter at room temperature into a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the stand mixer or a hand mixer, beat the butter on high speed until it becomes fluffy. Add ½ cup of light brown sugar and ½ cup of sugar to the butter and keep mixing for another 3 minutes until they are well blended. Then, add 3 large eggs one at a time to the bowl and mix them in. 
User: All ingredients are now fully mixed, what now? 
Robot: Now add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and the reserved melted bittersweet chocolate into the bowl and blend them in. Then, add ¼ cup of buttermilk or whole milk at room temperature and whisk it in. Add half of the dry ingredients and whisk them until fully incorporated. Repeat these two steps again until it's all well mixed and the batter is thick and frosty. 
User: The batter is now thick and frosty, what do I do now? 
Robot: Now boil ½ cup of water and, with the mixer at low speed, add the boiling water into the bowl and mix until it's fully incorporated. Then, add ⅔ cup semisweet chocolate chips to the batter and stir them in with a spatula. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans and divide it evenly. Bake the cakes for about 25-30 minutes. When they are done, remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool for 5 minutes before removing them from the pans and letting them cool fully for 2 hours. Once they are cooled you can proceed to make the frosting, let me know when you would like me to tell you the last steps for this recipe. 
User: The cakes are now fully cooled, how do I make the frosting? 
Robot: To make the frosting start by cutting the round top of each cake off using a knife. This will ensure the surface of the cake is flat. Take the cut off tops and crumble them, place it into a small bowl and set aside. 
User: I have cut the tops of the cakes off, now what? 
Robot: For this step make sure you are wearing an apron and appropriate footwear to avoid getting burned. Mix 1 cup of sugar, ¾ teaspoon of cream of tartar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover and let it boil for 3 minutes. Uncover the pan and with a candy thermometer check the temperature. Let the mixture boil until the thermometer reads 117º. While the syrup is cooking, separate the yolks from the egg whites of 4 large eggs and put them in a mixing bowl. When the syrup is at around 113º, beat the egg whites with a stand or hand mixer. When the syrup hits 117º, carefully pour it into the egg whites and keep mixing at medium speed. 
User: The egg whites and the syrup are now mixed, what’s next? 
Robot: Next, add 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract to the bowl and keep mixing at medium speed until the mixture cools down to room temperature. This should take 5 minutes. The resulting frosting should look marshmallowy. 
User: The frosting is now done, is there anything left for me to do? 
Robot: Now let’s assemble the cake. Place one of the cakes on a plate and frost it using an icing spatula. Top it with the second cake placing the cut side up and frost again, this time frost the sides too to blend both layers together. Cover the top and sides of the cakes with the crumbs pressing with your hands. Put the cake in the fridge for about an hour before serving it. Enjoy your meal.
