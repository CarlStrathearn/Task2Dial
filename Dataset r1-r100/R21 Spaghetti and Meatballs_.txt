User: I want to make Spaghetti and Meatballs
Robot: Okay, let’s begin. Start by preheating the oven at 232º and line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Then, place a wire rack on top and coat it lightly with cooking spray. Then, let’s start making the meatballs! Put ¾ cup of panko breadcrumbs and ½ cup of buttermilk into a large bowl and combine them together using a fork. Mash the paste and stir it. In a small bowl beat 1 large egg with a fork,then, add it into the bowl with the breadcrumb mixture. Stir it to combine using the fork. 
User: The egg is now incorporated into the breadcrumb mixture, what do I do now? 
Robot: Now, put 1 tablespoon of cold water and ½ teaspoon of powdered gelatin into a small bowl. Using a spoon stir the gelatin into the water until it's dissolved. Add the gelatin into the breadcrumb mixture and stir to combine. Chop 2 ounces of prosciutto using a knife and a cutting board. Then, mince 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley leaves and 1 garlic clove. Add these and 1 pound of ground beef, 28g of grated Parmesan cheese, ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon ground pepper into the breadcrumb mixture. Gently mix using your hands until combined. This is your meatball mixture.

Then, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a dutch oven and add the minced garlic and ¼ teaspoon of oregano into it.

Add  56 ounces (2 large cans) of crushed tomatoes, ⅓ cup of red cooking wine, ½ teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of ground pepper into the dutch oven and increase the heat to medium-high. Bring the sauce into a simmer and reduce it to medium-low, let it cook for 15 minutes until it thickens. The sauce is now done!

Using a pair of thongs, take the meatballs and place them into the dutch oven with the sauce and submerge them as much as possible. Cover the dutch oven with aluminum foil and place a lid over it. Place the dutch oven in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes. The last step is to make the pasta, you should start making it about 20 minutes before the meatballs are ready.
