User: I have the ingredients ready, are there any others that I will need or am I ready to begin?

User: The mixture is now crumbly after pulsating it for 5 seconds, I also scraped down the sides of the bowl. What is the next step?
Robot: With the food processor running, add 1 cup of water in a slow and steady stream until the dough just forms in a cohesive ball.
User: I added the cup of water to the dough and it has formed into a ball, what is the next step?
Robot: Knead for about 30 seconds more, until the dough becomes tacky, if the dough is too sticky, just add a bit more flour.
User: I kneaded it for 30 seconds and it has become tacky, no need for more flour, thank you. What is the next step?
Robot: Now transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide it into 8 equal pieces, then cover with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 10 minutes.
User: I moved the dough to a work surface and divided it into 8 equal pieces as required. What do I have to do next?

Robot: Dust lightly with flour and roll the dough into a very thin circle, approximately 8 inches in diameter.
