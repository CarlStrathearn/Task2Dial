User: I want to make Roasted Vegetable Lasagna
Robot: Okay, let’s begin. To start, preheat the oven at 190º and cover a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Grease it lightly with cooking spray. Then, using a knife and a cutting board, chop 3 carrots into slices, 1 large zucchini, cubed; 8 ounces of white mushrooms and 1 small red onion. Place the vegetables in a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, ½ tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, 1 teaspoon of sugar, ½ teaspoon of salt, ¼ teaspoon of pepper to the bowl with the vegetables and toss to combine. Place the veggies onto the prepared baking sheet and bake for about 20 minutes, until the veggies are tender. While they are baking in the oven, make the lasagna noodles. Let me know when you would like me to tell you how to make them.
User: The veggies are now in the oven, how do I make the noodles? 
Robot: To make the noodles fill a stock pot with 4 quarts of water and bring it to boil over high heat. Add 1 teaspoon of salt and cook 9 ounces of lasagna noodles for about 10 minutes.This should leave them al dente. When they are done, drain the pot and reserve the noodles. Now let’s make the cheese mixture. Start by beating 1 egg in a bowl and mincing 2 garlic cloves using a garlic press or a knife and cutting board. Put these into a medium bowl together with 2 cups of ricotta cheese and 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese.Stir the ingredients together with a spoon or spatula.
User: The noodles and cheese mixture are done, what now? 
Robot: Now let’s begin the assembly. To prepare, take your choice of pasta sauce and spread ¼ cup of it using a spoon on top of a baking dish, preferably a 9x13 inch. Take the bowl with the reserved veggies and add 1 ¾ cup of pasta sauce. Stir to combine. Now for the steps to assemble the lasagna. Firstly, layer a third of the noodles on top of the pasta sauce base; Secondly, cover the noodles with half of the cheese mixture; Thirdly, sprinkle baby spinach on top of the cheese; Finally, add ½ of the veggie mixture. Repeat this process one more time. Then, cover with one last layer of noodles. Add the remaining pasta sauce, 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup of parmesan cheese. The only steps left after this is cooking the lasagna, let me know when you would like me to tell you the times. 
User: The lasagna is now assembled, how long should I cook it for? 
Roboto: Put the lasagna in the oven and cook at 190º until the cheese melts, then reduce the temperature to 62º for 30-40 minutes. Let the lasagna cool for 10-20 minutes before serving and enjoy your meal.
